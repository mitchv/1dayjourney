	My name's Mitch, I'm a graphic designer & web developer with a passion for cartoons and video games, and I'm also a recovering alcoholic. We are surrounded every day with messages that make unhealthy vices in our lives sound fun, but what if sobriety and taking steps to realize our greatest potential could be even MORE entertaining? Enter 1DayJourney: a mobile & web app currently in development that helps you eliminate unhealthy compulsions, and plays like a high fantasy RPG. Instead of fighting dragons or vampires, your character battles user-defined enemies like cigarettes, fast food, self-harm or gambling, gaining strength every time you resist temptation and collecting bonus achievements for every consecutive day you eliminate that habit. Allies like Fyz the Fitness Barbarian and Mysteris the Mindfulness Sorcerer can join your party to notify you with daily real-life challenges, utilized in order to replace old habits with new, healthier ones and earn stronger weapons, magic and armor.
	<br>
	Gain experience, collect items, and defeat increasingly powerful monsters by tracking your habits every day. Compare your progress to other players or keep your stats completely private - it's up to you. In addition to providing motivation and rewards for staying on the path to wellness, this data can be exported as a calendar for therapeutic purposes to help a mental health professional learn what your greatest strengths and challenges are, and develop personal plans for conquering these monsters. Using all your discipline and help from your allies to succeed at the real-life challenges throughout the 30 day quests is roughly equivalent to an intensive outpatient program, and modifiable goals mean it can be accessible to anyone. I am grateful for all the help I have received so far realizing my dream, and your continued patronage will help bring it to fruition, with a playable beta version to be released in 2018!
