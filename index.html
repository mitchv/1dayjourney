	<div class="subflex">The player has 60 seconds per screen to figure out the solution to the puzzle. If it's not completed, they are reset to the door of that room and a plant grows on the tile they were standing on when they died. Multiple iterations will be required to advance through each level, as some of the puzzles involve watering the plants until they grow thicker, shining light on them, salting them etc.</div>
	<div class="subflex">One death - flower. Two deaths - shrub. Three deaths - tree. Neither water nor fertilizer: scrawny. Water but no fertilizer: thick but barren. Fertilizer but no water: leafy but spindly. Both water and fertilizer: thick and leafy. But water from too many different sides = drowned plant. Plant next to a wall - vine which will climb to the height of how many deaths happened there.</div>

	My name's Mitch, I'm a graphic designer & web developer with a passion for cartoons and video games, and I'm also a recovering alcoholic. We are surrounded every day with messages that make unhealthy vices in our lives sound fun, but what if sobriety and taking steps to realize our greatest potential could be even MORE entertaining? Enter 1DayJourney: a mobile & web app currently in development that helps you eliminate unhealthy compulsions, and plays like a high fantasy RPG. Instead of fighting dragons or vampires, your character battles user-defined enemies like cigarettes, fast food, self-harm or gambling, gaining strength every time you resist temptation and collecting bonus achievements for every consecutive day you eliminate that habit. Allies like Fyz the Fitness Barbarian and Mysteris the Mindfulness Sorcerer can join your party to notify you with daily real-life challenges, utilized in order to replace old habits with new, healthier ones and earn stronger weapons, magic and armor.
	<br>
	Gain experience, collect items, and defeat increasingly powerful monsters by tracking your habits every day. Compare your progress to other players or keep your stats completely private - it's up to you. In addition to providing motivation and rewards for staying on the path to wellness, this data can be exported as a calendar for therapeutic purposes to help a mental health professional learn what your greatest strengths and challenges are, and develop personal plans for conquering these monsters. Using all your discipline and help from your allies to succeed at the real-life challenges throughout the 30 day quests is roughly equivalent to an intensive outpatient program, and modifiable goals mean it can be accessible to anyone. I am grateful for all the help I have received so far realizing my dream, and your continued patronage will help bring it to fruition, with a playable beta version to be released in 2018!
